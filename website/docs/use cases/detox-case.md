# Use Cases for Copilot by Detox

**Copilot by Detox** is designed to empower developers by simplifying the way they write tests for their applications. The tool is inherently framework-agnostic, making it adaptable to a wide range of testing frameworks with minimal customization.

---

## Current Example: Detox Integration

Detox is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for mobile apps. Copilot can integrate with Detox to allow developers to:

- **Write tests in natural language**: Skip manual test scripting and focus on describing app behavior in clear, intuitive commands.
- **Leverage existing Detox APIs**: Seamlessly use matchers and actions like `by.id()`, `tap()`, and `longPress()` to interact with app elements.
- **Enhance debugging with snapshots**: Capture screenshots and view hierarchies to better understand the app's state during testing.

For example, a test to tap a login button and check for a success message can be as simple as:

```plain
Tap the "Login" button and verify that the success message appears.
```
This natural language prompt would be translated by Copilot into the following Detox code:
```js
await element(by.id('loginButton')).tap();
await expect(element(by.text('Success'))).toBeVisible();
```
By automating this translation, Copilot saves time, reduces the potential for errors, and lowers the barrier to entry for writing tests.

## Collaboration: Open for New Frameworks

**Copilot by Detox** is built with flexibility at its core, enabling seamless integration with a variety of testing frameworks. Its framework-agnostic design ensures that it can adapt to different testing environments without being tied to any single framework.

Detox is only one example of whatâ€™s possible. We encourage contributions to expand Copilot's capabilities and extend its compatibility to other frameworks. Whether you're adding support for a new framework or refining existing integrations, your input can help shape the future of Copilot.
